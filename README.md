# Temp-LEDgraph

This following program measures the surrounding temperature using LM35 and 
shows the output in LED graph.

To do this , you will need
1. An Arduino Uno.
2. 8 LEDs.
3. 8 220Ω resistors.
4. Jumping wires.

Connect all the LEDs to the digital pins , each through 220Ω resistor and upload the code Temp_blink.ino
